# OpenBeam
A project started by Terrence Tam and Mike Ziomkowski and their company ZT Automations.

## Background
While technical details on the OpenBeam project have been released under [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode), it has been difficult to find all of the different documents as they are spread across blog posts on [OpenBeamUSA.com](http://openbeamusa.com) as well as [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse). This is a consolidation of the technical (schematics) details of the OpenBeam 1515 extrusions and associated components.

## Purchase
ZT Automations has an extensive [store on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_il_to_merchant-items?me=A2J9I03OJ1NNQD) for purchasing all of their components.

## Applications
- PCBGrip
